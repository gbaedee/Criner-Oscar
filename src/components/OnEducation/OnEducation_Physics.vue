                Physics has been one of  my most enjoyable subjects.  It has been 
                a subject that I have studied most of my life. My study of 
                physics began when I was a child.  I initially wanted to be 
                astronomer.  Sometime when I was teenager I read a little book 
                by Lincoln Barnett entitled The Universe and Dr. Einstein, which 
                pointed my interest to both physics and astronomy. A little later 
                in college I ran across Hans Reichenbach's The Direction of Time 
                which was an extremely lucid  and readable exposition of the 
                theory of relativity.
