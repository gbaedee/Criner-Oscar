            <h4> The Abstraction of Language</h4>
            <p class="left-align">
              Many people have wondered why mathematical scientists are very 
              often good musicians. I found the study of music, drama, and art 
              especially helpful in the study of science and mathematics.  
            </p>
            <p class="left-align">
             One secret to the study of mathematics is in the study of music.  
             The methods to which students of music are subjected train the 
             memory and enhance pattern recognition.  The study of mathematics 
             requires a great deal of pattern recognition. Indeed, the expression 
             "of the form" is repeated through mathematics.

              Elbert F. Cox, Ph.D. was the first black person in the world to 
              earn a doctorate in mathematics. I began my serious study of 
              mathematics under Professor Cox.

              Professor Cox was an unusual teacher who taught me much more that 
              the mathematics. He wanted to develop a mathematical initiative in 
              students. Those who showed initiative received his utmost attention.  Those who merely sat in the class, got a lecture.
