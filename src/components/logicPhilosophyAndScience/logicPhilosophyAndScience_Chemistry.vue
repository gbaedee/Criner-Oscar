              The definition I was given in school was that chemistry is the study 
              of matter and the changes that matter undergoes.

              We encounter chemical processes every day. They have been 
              fundamental to the well being of human beings since the 
              discovery of how to control fire. What we perceive as the 
              simplest chemical processes, i.e., the burning of a simple 
              methane flame, are among the most complex that we try to 
              describe in science.
