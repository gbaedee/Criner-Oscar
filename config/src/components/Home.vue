              This site is intended to help you succeed in college and introduce 
              you to the academic profession. I want you to experience the joy of 
              scholarship.

              For me, scholarship is something you do because you must. You have 
              a curosity about all things. You want to know. You want to do. There 
              may be no other reason to study except that you want to know about 
              subject.

              Do not confuse higher education with job training. While employment 
              is one outcome of higher education, it should not be the focus of 
              your college career. However, for those who succeed at scholarship, 
              the rewards are very great.
            </p>

              However, scholarship is not usually considered a profession.
              But there is a very great need for scholars in the United States,
              especially for those who are native born. Teaching is what 
              scholars do, but it is not all we do. We are also entrepreneurs,
              writers, businesspersons, artists, musicians, scientists, mathematicians, 
              researchers, and engaged in a host of other endeavors.

              This site is intended to encourage students and show how to develop skills
              at scholarship; and to consider becoming ascholar and  college teacher. There 
              is a critical shortage of African American scholars and teachers and this is 
              especially true in all historically black colleges and universities (HBCUs). 
              This is expecially devastating in the mathematical and computational sciences.
              The chart below shows the number of people applying to my university who chose 
              various majors to study. Most of these people have not been on our campus. They 
              have just graduated high school.
